Sinatra 101
This repository is a tutorial for a first contact with the Sinatra gem, a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort.

Architecture
We coded a simple MVC architecture where the user communicated his/her intent thanks to the router infinite loop, gets-ing a number and converting it into a Controller method call. In the end, the view gives the information back to the user thanks to the simple puts.

A web app is really close to this behavior, with two minor differences. First, we use a framework (like Sinatra) to handle the router part. Here, the user expresses his/her intent with an HTTP request. It's up to the framework to route this HTTP request to the correct action in the Controller. In the end, the view is responsible to build HTML which is sent back to the user.



Setup
Create a new folder to put your sinatra app in. For instance:

(replace $GITHUB_USERNAME with your own name!!)

mkdir ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/cookbook-sinatra
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/cookbook-sinatra
git init  # That's a brand new repo!
In this directory, we create a Gemfile to specify which gems we'd like to use in this project.

touch Gemfile
Open this Gemfile in Sublime Text (stt) and copy-paste this code:

source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "better_errors"
gem "binding_of_caller"
gem "pry-byebug"
gem "sinatra"
gem "sinatra-contrib"
gem "thin"
In the terminal, run the following command to fetch the gems specified in the Gemfile:

bundle install
In your git status, you should see 2 files: Gemfile and Gemfile.lock. The Gemfile is where you put your project dependencies (i.e. which gem you want to require in your project), and the Gemfile.lock is an auto-generated file which specifies versions for each gem. It locks them actually.

Time for some checkpoint, we can commit our work:

git status
# There should be 2 files here
git add .
git commit -m "Init sinatra project"
Now we'll also proudly push our code to GitHub :)

gh repo create --public --source=.
git push origin master
You can open this project in GitHub with gh repo view --web.

OK we're ready to write some code!

Sinatra app
Create a file at the directory root which will be the Sinatra app main file, the entry point, the one we want to run:

touch app.rb
In this file, you can copy/paste with this boilerplate:

require "sinatra"
require "sinatra/reloader" if development?
require "pry-byebug"
require "better_errors"

configure :development do
  use BetterErrors::Middleware
  BetterErrors.application_root = File.expand_path('..', __FILE__)
end

get "/" do
  "Hello world!"
end

That's it. It says that for an HTTP request at the root (/), it will return Hello world!. Open a new tab in your terminal and run this:

ruby app.rb
You should get this output:

== Sinatra (v2.1.0) has taken the stage on 4567 for development with backup from Thin
2022-02-01 14:59:35 +0100 Thin web server (v1.8.1 codename Infinite Smoothie)
2022-02-01 14:59:35 +0100 Maximum connections set to 1024
2022-02-01 14:59:35 +0100 Listening on localhost:4567, CTRL+C to stop

You can see that this command does not return. It's running forever, like a while loop. And it says that's is running a web server on port 4567. That means that you can open your browser and go to localhost:4567 and see Hello world.

Great you made your first web server and your first HTTP request to it!

If you change the Hello world string with something else, save the file, go back to the browser, hit refresh, you should see your change appear. Handy!

Let me break it to you, the app.rb will act as the Router and the Controller of your MVC app. The routing part is the get '/' and the controller part is the blocks passed to the get (and other HTTP verbs as we'll see...) method.

get "/" do  # <- Router part

  # [...]   #
  # [...]   # <- Controller part
  # [...]   #

end
Time for a commit:

git status          # What changed?
git add app.rb
git commit -m "Boilerplate sinatra app"
git push origin master

Views
Technically, instead of Hello world, you'd want to return some HTML. Try returning <h1>Hello <em>world</em>!</h1> for instance. See?

Writing HTML directly inside the app.rb file is not really the way to go. That'll be for other stuff (controller stuff). We want to create dedicated file for the View part of our MVC app, a file where we can play nicely with HTML. Inside the root directory of the project, run the commands:

mkdir views
touch views/index.erb
Then go back in Sublime Text in the app.rb file and change the root block:

# [...]

get "/" do
  erb :index
end

Open the views/index.erb file in Sublime Text and paste some HTML code, for instance

<p>
  I'm in a <em>view</em>!
</p>

OK, go back to your browser and hit refresh. Awesome ðŸŽ‰, right?

Routing
Our app is currently very small, with just one route. What if we'd want to add an /about page to our website to brag about our new web development skills?

Open the app.rb file in Sublime Text, and add a new route, at the bottom of the file:

# [...]

get "/about" do
  erb :about
end

You get the gist. Create a new view:

touch views/about.erb
And in this view you can put some more HTML:

<h1>The team</h1>

<ul>
  <li>My buddy</li>
  <li>Me</li>
</ul>

Go back to the browser and go to localhost:4567/about. Awesome right?

Other verbs
You can create routes for POST requests (the one the browser does when you fill in a <form /> and hit the submit button). Works the same, see the routing part of the doc

Parameters
If you read on the Routes section of the documentation, we'll see that it talks about the magic params. Until now in this tutorial we only dealt with static routes. What if you want a generic URL for all the people in your team? Say you want this:

/team/me
/team/my_buddy
# etc.
Do not write a route for every case! That's not how we code :) Instead, you see the emergence of a parameter. So we'll write this route:

# [...]

get "/team/:username" do
  puts params[:username]
  "The username is #{params[:username]}"
end

Save your app.rb file and go to localhost:4567/team/ssaunier and localhost:4567/team/Papillard. See how you can pass parameters from the URL to the controller in app.rb?

Do not hesitate to put a binding.pry at the beginning of each controller block to inspect in the terminal what you have in params. Very useful ðŸ‘‡

get "/team/:username" do
  binding.pry  # <= code will stop here for HTTP request localhost:4567/team/someone
  # [...]
end

Oh and I forgot, params can be filled from 3 places:

Routing parameters (like /team/:username)
Query string parameters (if the URL is like /search?keyword=lewagon)
Body from HTTP POST queries (coming from <form action="post" />)
Passing stuff to the view
In the MVC pattern, we've seen that the controller will ask some info to the Model (with the help of a Repository handling CSV), and then ask the view to display that info. Here the controller code is inside app.rb and the view gets called when writing erb :view_name.

First of all, notice that the view file extension is .erb. It means Embedded RuBy. So you don't have to limit yourself to plain HTML in here, you can also write Ruby code and output it! For instance, try in the views/index.erb file:

<%= Time.now %>
Reload the page several time. See?

Be careful, you can use <% %> or <%= %>. The former won't output the result of your Ruby code inside the HTML. Useful for .each blocks:

<ul>
  <% [ "Papillard", "ssaunier" ].each do |username| %>
    <li>
      <%= username %>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

See? We just dynamically generated an HTML <ul /> element!

OK great, but again, we're just handling static data. In the pure Ruby MVC apps (Cookbook and Food Delivery), the controller passed some arguments to the view. How can we do that here? Well, very simple, we'll define instance variables in the Controller, and they'll be automatically passed to the view :)

# app.rb

# [...]
get "/" do
  @usernames = [ "ssaunier", "Papillard" ]
  erb :index
end
<!-- views/index.erb -->

<% @usernames.each do |username| %>
  <li>
    <%= username %>
  </li>
<% end %>

You see, simple: @usernames instance variable in the controller and you can use them in the view. Awesome ðŸŽ‰!

Layout
You can put all your views inside a layout, meaning they will all share some code (a navbar, a footer, etc.). Here's how you do it with Sinatra.

mkdir public
touch public/application.css
touch public/application.js
touch views/layout.erb
Open the views/layout.erb file in Sublime Text and copy/paste this boilerplate layout which uses Bootstrap and jQuery:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <title>Cookbook Sinatra</title>

    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free@5.15.4/css/fontawesome.min.css" integrity="sha384-jLKHWM3JRmfMU0A5x5AkjWkw/EYfGUAGagvnfryNV3F9VqM98XiIH7VBGVoxVSc7" crossorigin="anonymous">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/application.css">
  </head>
  <body>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
          <%= yield %>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>


    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="/application.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

You can notice in this boilerplate the <%= yield %> line. It's where your specific view will be inserted.

You can add some CSS in the public/application.css file and some JavaScript in the public/application.js one.

Share with the world
Proud of your app? You'd like other people to see it? Well, they can't access your localhost. So we'll have to do some more configuration.

First, kill your server with Ctrl + C. Open your app.rb and after all the require, add this line:

set :bind, "0.0.0.0"
In the terminal, restart the server with ruby app.rb. Now the server will be able to listen to external incoming requests. To get your local IP address, you can run the following command:

ifconfig -a | perl -nle'/(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)/ && print '
You should see your IP address (something like 192.168.x.x or 10.0.x.x). Then other people on the local network will be able to access your app with http://your_ip_address:4567.

If you want to share your app with people outside the local network (someone at home for instance), we'll use ngrok.

On OSX, you can get it with:

brew install --cask ngrok
(On Ubuntu, you'll have to download it manually, follow the tutorial)

Then open a new terminal and run:

ngrok http 4567
Like for ruby app.rb, it will run in a loop. You'll see something like this:

# [...]
# Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
# Forwarding                    http://________.ngrok.io -> localhost:4567
# Forwarding                    https://________.ngrok.io -> localhost:4567
Open your web browser and go to the http(s)://???.ngrok.io URL given by the interface. Great, you can see your app! And so can anybody on the Internet, just share this URL with your friend, on Slack, anywhere ðŸŽ‰ !
